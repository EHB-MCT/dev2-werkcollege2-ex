# The most expensive paintings

> Tip: try to pay attention to the benefits of using string literals or array methods.

## Step 1:

Make sure all paintings are shown on the web page. Use the html snippet in index.html to do this.


## Step 2:

Add eventHandlers for all radioButtons. The values of the radioButtons are kept under gallery.userInput.


## Step 3:

Create a sort function. Depending on the userInput, it sorts by price or title.


## Step 4:

Create a filter function. This filters the paintings based on the selected artist. Also provide an all option.


## Step 5:

Make sure your web page continues to function correctly in all circumstances. If the user first sorts by title and then filters by a particular artist, the results should still be sorted by title and vice versa.


## Step 6 (additional):

Calculate the total price of the displayed paintings and display it in #total. Use an array function for this.
